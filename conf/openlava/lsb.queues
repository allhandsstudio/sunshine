# Queue definition profile. This file affects the scheduling behavior of the
# openlava Batch system on jobs submitted to queues.  Each queue is defined in a
# Queue section enclosed by Begin Queue and End Queue

# Queues with higher PRIORITY (larger values) are searched first
# during scheduling. Default values are provided.

# QJOB_LIMIT is the max number of job slots that can be used by jobs
# from this queue. The default is unlimited.

# UJOB_LIMIT is the max number of job slots that can be used for
# jobs from this queue for any one user. The default is unlimited.

# PJOB_LIMIT is the max number of job slots that can be used for jobs
# from this queue on any one processor. The default is unlimited.

# HJOB_LIMIT specifies the number of jobs that can be dispatched
# to a host regardless of the number of processors on the host.

# DISPATCH_WINDOW describes the time window during which jobs are dispatched.
# Time windows can be specified as up to 3 fields -- [day:]hour[:minute].
# Note that day=[0-6]: 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday and 6 is Saturday.  If only
# one field exists, it is assumed to be hour; if two fields exist, it is
# assumed to be hour[:minute]. Multiple windows can be specified.  The
# default is any time.

# RUN_WINDOW has the same function as DISPATCH_WINDOW.  In addition, jobs
# will be suspended when the windows are closed.

# For each of the interested load indices, see lsf.h for definitions of
# the available load indices. The load indices considered by Lava are:
# r15s, r1m, r15m, ut, pg, it, ls, swp, tmp, mem, io. If any of these
# are not specified here, then the default is to make the load index
# have no effect on job scheduling.

# CPULIMIT, FILELIMIT, DATALIMIT, STACKLIMIT, CORELIMIT, MEMLIMIT,
# are limits for various resources (see setrlimit(2)) a job in
# this queue may use.  These are the hard limits. The limits users specify
# when submitting jobs are soft limits. If any of these is not defined, then
# the limit is assumed to be infinity. All except CPULIMIT are in kilobytes.
# CPULIMIT is in minutes.  The CPULIMIT is enforced on a job level basis
# while the other limits are enforced on a per-process basis.  When the
# CPULIMIT is reached, SIGXCPU is sent to the job, followed by SIGINT,
# SIGTERM, and SIGKILL in sequence.

# PROCLIMIT is the processor limit (parallelism limit) for a parallel job
# which can be accepted by this queue.  If a submitted job requests more
# processors than this limit, the job is rejected.  If this is not defined,
# the default value is infinity.

# SWAPLIMIT specifies the maximum virtual memory of all processes in a job
# and is specified in units of kbytes.  SIGQUIT is sent to the job when
# this limit is reached, followed by SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL in
# sequence.

# PROCESSLIMIT specifies the number of concurrent processes that can be part
# of a job.  SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL are sent to the job in sequence
# when this limit is reached.

# USERS limits users that can submit jobs to this queue (default is all
# users).

# HOSTS limits the hosts on which jobs submitted to this queue may execute.

# ADMINISTRATORS limits the users that can operate on jobs in this queue and
# on the queue itself.

# PRE_EXEC is a command which is executed before a job dispatched from this
# queue is run on an execution host. It is executed under the job's user ID
# with standard input, output and error redirected to /dev/null.

# POST_EXEC is a command which is executed after the job dispatched from this
# queue has finished running on the execution host. It is also run if the
# PRE_EXEC command exited with a 0 exit status, but the job's execution
# environment failed to be setup. It is executed under the job's user ID
# with standard input, output and error redirected to /dev/null.

# REQUEUE_EXIT_VALUES are exit values used by Lava to requeue the jobs
# dispatched from this queue.  The keyword, EXCLUDE, specifies that the
# job will never be re-dispatched to a host that it has failed on.  E.g.,
#
# 	REQUEUE_EXIT_VALUES = 30 EXCLUDE(2)
#
# specifies that jobs that exit with the value 30 will be requeued (and
# possibly re-dispatched to one of the failed hosts), while jobs
# that exit with the value 2 will be requeued but will not be re-dispatched
# to one of the failed hosts.

# RES_REQ is a resource requirement string specifying the condition for
# dispatching a job to a host.  Resource reservation and locality can
# also be specified in this string.

# STOP_COND is a resource requirement string specifying the condition for
# stopping a running job.  Only the 'select' section of the string
# is considered when stopping a job.

# RESUME_COND is a resource requirement string specifying the condition for
# resuming a suspended job.  Only the 'select' section of the string
# is considered when resuming a stopped job.

# JOB_CONTROLS = SUSPEND[signal | CHKPNT | command ] |
#                RESUME[signal | command ] |
#                TERMINATE[signal | CHKPNT | command ]
# specifies the action to be taken when a job is normally suspended or
# resumed by a user or by the system.  TERMINATE is used in conjunction
# with the TERMINATE_WHEN parameter (see below) to specify an action
# to terminate a job rather then stopping a job when conditions are
# stopping the job are satisfied.

# TERMINATE_WHEN = [ WINDOW ] [ LOAD ]
# Specifies that the TERMINATE action specified in the JOB_CONTROLS
# parameter be invoked when the queue's run window closes or the load
# exceeds thresholds.

# NEW_JOB_SCHED_DELAY specifies when a scheduling session is triggered
# when a new job is submitted.  The default value is 10s, meaning a
# new scheduling session is started 10s after accepting a new job.
# If this value is 0s, a new scheduling session is started as soon as a
# job is submitted to this queue.  This allows faster response times,
# but will generate additional load on the mbatchd host.

# INTERACTIVE = Y | y | N | n | ONLY
# INTERACTIVE specifies whether the queue should not accept Lava Batch
# interactive jobs (INTERACTIVE = 'n' | 'N'), or should only accept
# interactive jobs (INTERACTIVE = ONLY).  An Lava Batch interactive job
# is submitted using the -I options of bsub.  By default, a queue
# accepts both interactive and non-interactive jobs.

# JOB_STARTER specifies a job starter command for jobs in the queue.
# When starting a job, Lava runs the JOB_STARTER command, and passes
# the shell script containing the job's commands as the argument to
# the JOB_STARTER.  The JOB_STARTER is expected to do some processing
# and then run the shell script containing the job's commands.
# The command is run under /bin/sh -c and thus can contain any valid
# Bourne shell syntax.

# CHKPNT = chkpnt_diretory [chkpnt_period_in_minute]
# Jobs submitted to the queue with this option will be checkpoint-ed
# automatically every chkpnt_period_in_minute's. The chkpnt_directory
# should be created already. Otherwise, no chkpnt will be performed.
# The chkpnt period is optional. If it is supplied, default value is
# used.

# RERUNNABLE   = Y | y | N | n
# Jobs submitted to the queue with this option will be rerunnable.
# The default value is 'n'.

# ROUND_ROBIN_POLICY = Y | y
# If defined the jobs in the queue are scheduled using a round robin
# algorithm weighted on the number of users' jobs.
# If the jobs are sorted by user priority then highest priority jobs
# are round robin first, then the second highest and so on.
#

# PRE_POST_EXEC_USER = user
# By default, both the pre- and post-execution commands are run as
# the job submission user. Use the PRE_POST_EXEC_USER parameter to
# specify a different user ID for queue-level pre- and post-execution
# commands.
#

# PREEMPTTION = PREEMPTIVE[list of queues]
# If defined in a queue the list of queues specified by name and separated
# by space can be preempted by the given queue. Any queue in the list must
# have lower priority then the preemptive one. Only jobs that pend for slots
# reason i.e. pending reason PEND_HOST_JOB_LIMIT (Job slot limit reached)
# as displayed by 'bjobs -l' can initiate preemption.
# Note the preemptive and preemtable queue must be compatible from the
# resource perspective by sharing the same hosts. The preemption algorithm
# searches from the shortest running jobs until it finds a first match
# and then requeue back to pend the preemptable jobs.
#
# FAIRSHARE specifies that the fairshare policy is used to schedule jobs
# in the queue.  By default, jobs are scheduled on a FIFO basis.
# The fairshare scheduler allocates a certain portion of the queue
# slot to each participant user.
# The keyword, USER_SHARES, is used to specify the shares for each user.
# The value of USER_SHARES consists of one or more [username, share] pairs;
# e.g., FAIRSHARE = USER_SHARES[[group_a, 3] [group_b , 1]].
# The individual shares are summed up and then normalized. In this case
# 3 + 1 = 4 and group_a will have 3/4 of the queue slots and group_b
# 1/4 of the queue slots. The shares should be further subdivided to users
# in lsb.users.
